## Week 0
It took quite a while to find the libraries and API that I needed to use for my project. So far, I've demoed the IBM Watson API and it seems to work brilliantly as it correctly deciphers the emotion from all unambiguous bodies of text. Also, the wrapper library for openFrameworks seems to do a good job of parsing JSON.
