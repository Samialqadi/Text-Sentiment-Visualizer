# Development Log
## In Progress
- Parse JSON from API with library
- Explore openFrameworks GUI functionalities

## Completed
- Explored JSON library
- Explored IBM Watson API
- Make API calls through https://github.com/mrtazz/restclient-cpp
- Mockup designs for UI

## Week 0
It took quite a while to find the libraries and API that I needed to use for my project. So far, I've demoed the IBM Watson API and it seems to work brilliantly as it correctly deciphers the emotion from all unambiguous bodies of text. Also, the wrapper library for openFrameworks seems to do a good job of parsing JSON.

## Week 1
I have added another library from what I initially thought I needed in order to make POST requests to the API. I had to go through many different libraries in order to find one that wasn't convoluted and poorly documented. I ended up with https://github.com/mrtazz/restclient-cpp and with this I can now call the API.
I have also added yet another library from what I initially intended to parse JSON as this one is much more popular and better documented.

Moving away from the technical side of things, I created mockup GUI designs to help guide me throughout the frontend development of the project.
